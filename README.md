# Design Concepts
I recently made a choice to spend more of my time working on design concepts, which I'll be [sharing over Medium](http://medium.com/@raveeshbhalla). Besides sharing final prototypes, I thought it would be worthwhile to share the Sketch file and any other resources I use for the projects over on Github.

####List of Concepts
